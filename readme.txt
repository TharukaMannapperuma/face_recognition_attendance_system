Hi,

Install all the required libraries 
First add your database details to the utils file
Second change below variables in main.py
	threshold_red = 37    - Temperature threshold to set label color red in temperature readings
	threshold_start = 33  - Temperature threashold to start face recognition

you can use i2ctempTest.py to test temperature sensor.
